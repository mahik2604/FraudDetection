# Fraudulent Transaction Detection Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for developing a model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The goal is to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent activities using insights from the model. The dataset used for this project is available in CSV format and consists of 6,362,620 rows and 10 columns.

## Data Dictionary & Source Acquisition
- Data Dictionary: [Data Dictionary.txt](Data%20Dictionary.txt)
- Data Source: [Fraud.txt](Fraud.txt)

The [Data Dictionary.txt](Data%20Dictionary.txt) file contains detailed information about the columns in the dataset, providing insights into the meaning and type of each variable. The actual data can be found in the [Fraud.txt](Fraud.txt) file.

## Jupyter Notebook
The steps for proactive fraud detection were executed in a Jupyter Notebook. The notebook includes the following tasks:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Handling missing values
   - Identifying and addressing outliers
   - Dealing with multi-collinearity

2. Fraud Detection Model:
   - Development of a predictive model for fraud detection using Random Forest Classifier

## Performance Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using a robust set of tools, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Visualizations and summary statistics are presented to provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's effectiveness.

## Key Predictive Factors
The key factors predicting fraudulent customer behavior are identified through feature importance analysis. These factors play a crucial role in determining whether a transaction is likely to be fraudulent or legitimate.

## Interpreting Predictive Factors
The identified predictive factors align with our understanding of fraudulent activities. They make sense in the context of financial fraud, as they capture patterns and behaviors indicative of potential fraud.

## Preventive Measures for Infrastructure Update

Enhance security through real-time transaction monitoring, multi-factor authentication, transaction limits, machine learning models, behavioral analysis, IP tracking, and regular audits.

## Assessing Prevention Effectiveness

Evaluate impact by analyzing historical fraud rates, minimizing false positives/negatives, monitoring model performance, collecting user feedback, reducing financial losses, reviewing incident reports, and ensuring continuous improvement.
